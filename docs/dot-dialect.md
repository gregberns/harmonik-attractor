# Attractor DOT Dialect Reference

Attractor pipelines use a **strict subset** of the Graphviz DOT language with custom extensions. This document is the authoritative reference for what the `attractor-dot` parser accepts. Code that generates DOT for attractor (including `pas generate`) must conform to these rules.

## Grammar

Only directed graphs are supported. The parser rejects `graph`, `strict`, and `--` edges.

```
digraph  : 'digraph' NAME '{' stmt* '}'

stmt     : graph_attr    -- graph [ attr_block ]
         | node_default  -- node [ attr_block ]
         | edge_default  -- edge [ attr_block ]
         | subgraph      -- subgraph NAME? { stmt* }
         | node_stmt     -- NAME [ attr_block ]?
         | edge_stmt     -- NAME ( '->' NAME )+ [ attr_block ]?
         | decl          -- NAME '=' VALUE

NAME     : [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*

attr_block : '[' ( KEY '=' VALUE ( [,;]? KEY '=' VALUE )* )? ']'

KEY      : NAME ( '.' NAME )*          -- dotted keys allowed (e.g. style.model)
```

## Identifiers (NAME)

Must start with an ASCII letter or underscore, followed by ASCII alphanumerics or underscores.

| Valid | Invalid | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `my_node` | `"my node"` | Quoted IDs not supported |
| `step_1` | `1step` | Cannot start with a digit |
| `nodeA` | `42` | Numeric-only IDs not supported |
| `cluster_main` | `node:port` | Port syntax not supported |

Use `snake_case` for node IDs. Keep them short and descriptive.

## Attribute Values

The parser recognizes five value types, tried in this order:

| Type | Syntax | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| **String** | Double-quoted | `"hello"`, `"line1\nline2"` |
| **Boolean** | Bare literal | `true`, `false` |
| **Duration** | Integer + suffix (unquoted) | `120s`, `250ms`, `15m`, `2h`, `7d` |
| **Float** | Digits `.` digits | `1.5`, `-0.75` |
| **Integer** | Optional sign + digits | `42`, `-3`, `+10` |

Semantic discriminator attributes must be strings even though the dialect also
supports typed scalar values. Quote values for `shape`, `type`, `node_type`,
`handler`, `prompt`, `llm_provider`, `agent`, `reasoning_effort`, `class`,
`classes`, `stylesheet`, and
`model_stylesheet`. A non-string value such as `shape=123` or `prompt=true` is
an `InvalidAttributeType` compilation error; PAS does not discard it and infer
an executable default.

### Strings

- Delimited by double quotes: `"content"`
- Escape sequences: `\n` (newline), `\t` (tab), `\\` (backslash), `\"` (quote)
- Can span multiple lines (the newlines are literal)
- Unrecognized escapes like `\x` are kept verbatim as `\x`

### Duration (attractor extension)

Not part of standard Graphviz. Unquoted integer followed by a time suffix:

| Suffix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `ms` | milliseconds | `250ms` |
| `s` | seconds | `120s` |
| `m` | minutes | `15m` |
| `h` | hours | `2h` |
| `d` | days | `7d` |

Quoted durations (e.g. `"120s"`, `"5m"`) parse as strings, not Duration values. The engine handles both forms, but prefer unquoted for clarity.

### Dotted keys (attractor extension)

Attribute keys can use dots for namespacing: `style.model`, `config.max_retries`. Not part of standard Graphviz.

## Attribute Separators

Inside `[ ]` blocks, attributes can be separated by commas, semicolons, or just whitespace:

```dot
// All equivalent:
node_a [label="A", shape="box", timeout=600s]
node_a [label="A"; shape="box"; timeout=600s]
node_a [label="A" shape="box" timeout=600s]
```

Only one `[ ]` block per statement is consumed. Chained blocks (`[a=1][b=2]`) are **not** supported.

## Comments

```dot
// Line comment (to end of line)
/* Block comment
   (may span multiple lines) */
```

`#` preprocessor comments are **not** supported.

Comments inside strings are preserved verbatim (not treated as comments).

## Default Blocks

Set defaults for all subsequent nodes or edges in the current scope:

```dot
node [shape="box", timeout=600s]    // all nodes below get these defaults
edge [color="gray"]                 // all edges below get these defaults
graph [label="My Pipeline"]         // graph-level attributes
```

Defaults propagate into subgraphs. Subgraph-level defaults override parent defaults.

## Subgraphs

```dot
subgraph my_group {
    a -> b -> c
}

// Anonymous (no name)
subgraph {
    x -> y
}
```

Subgraph names follow the same ID rules (bare identifiers only). The `cluster_` prefix has no special semantic meaning to the attractor parser (unlike Graphviz renderers).

## Edge Chains

Chained edges expand into pairwise edges sharing the same attributes:

```dot
// This:
a -> b -> c [label="flow"]

// Becomes two edges:
//   a -> b [label="flow"]
//   b -> c [label="flow"]
```

Nodes referenced in edges are implicitly created (with current node defaults) if not explicitly declared.

## NOT Supported

These standard Graphviz DOT features will cause parse errors or be silently ignored:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Undirected graphs (`graph G { }`) | **Parse error** |
| Undirected edges (`a -- b`) | **Parse error** |
| `strict` keyword | **Parse error** |
| Quoted node IDs (`"my node"`) | **Parse error** |
| Numeric node IDs (`42 -> 99`) | **Parse error** |
| HTML labels (`<B>text</B>`) | **Parse error** |
| Port syntax (`node:port:compass`) | **Parse error** |
| String concatenation (`"a" + "b"`) | **Parse error** |
| Subgraph as edge endpoint (`{a b} -> c`) | **Parse error** |
| Chained attr blocks (`[a=1][b=2]`) | Second block ignored |
| `#` preprocessor comments | Not recognized |
| Floats without leading digit (`.5`) | **Parse error** (use `0.5`) |
| Scientific notation (`1e-3`) | **Parse error** |

---

# Pipeline Semantics

The grammar above defines what **parses**. This section defines what the attractor pipeline **engine** does with the parsed graph.

## Node Shapes and Handlers

| Shape | Role | Handler | Required Attributes |
|-------|------|---------|---------------------|
| `Mdiamond` | **Start** -- entry point, exactly one | StartHandler | none |
| `Msquare` | **Exit** -- pipeline completion, exactly one | ExitHandler | none |
| `box` | **Task** -- runs the selected provider CLI; `prompt` is optional | CodergenHandler | `llm_provider` |
| `diamond` with a prompt | **LLM conditional** -- provider output picks the outgoing edge | CodergenHandler | `prompt`, `llm_provider` |
| `diamond` without a prompt or explicit `type="codergen"` | **Conditional** -- pass-through routing | ConditionalHandler | none |
| `diamond` with explicit `type="codergen"` | **LLM conditional** -- provider output picks the outgoing edge, even when `prompt` is absent | CodergenHandler | `llm_provider`; `prompt` is optional |
| `hexagon` | **Human gate** -- pauses for human approval | WaitHumanHandler | none |
| `parallelogram` | **Tool** -- runs a shell command | ToolHandler | `tool_command` |
| `component` | **Sequential compatibility** -- pass-through with at most one outgoing edge | ParallelHandler | none |
| `tripleoctagon` | **Recognized fan-in syntax** -- rejected during semantic compilation | Not executable | none |

### Unsupported execution topology

The parser and semantic classifier recognize `component`/`parallel` and `tripleoctagon`/`fan_in` spellings, but recognition does not imply fork/join support. PAS follows exactly one successor per execution step and has no branch-result merge state.

- A resolved parallel node with zero or one outgoing edge compiles as sequential compatibility.
- A resolved parallel node with more than one outgoing edge fails semantic compilation. Authored edges are counted individually, even when several name the same target.
- Every resolved fan-in node fails semantic compilation, regardless of edge cardinality.

These failures use the node-scoped `unsupported_execution_topology` rule and occur before handler, provider, or checkpoint activity. Linearize the graph until fork/join execution is supported end to end.

## Node Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `label` | string | node ID | Display name in logs |
| `prompt` | string | -- | Task sent to the selected provider CLI. Its presence makes a conditional LLM-backed; explicit `type="codergen"` does so even without a prompt. |
| `shape` | string | -- | Node shape (see table above) |
| `type` | string | auto | Handler override: `"codergen"`, `"conditional"`, `"tool"`, `"parallel"`, `"fan_in"`, `"quality"`, `"wait.human"`, `"beads.select"`, `"beads.close"` (see [Beads handlers](#beads-handlers)); fan-in and manager roles are recognized but rejected |
| `agent` | string | -- | The [agent profile](cli-reference.md#agent-profiles-agentsname-in-pastoml) the node runs with, e.g. `"claude"` or a profile from `pas.toml`. Satisfies the provider requirement. With `llm_provider` too, `agent` wins. Node attribute only (not a stylesheet property). |
| `llm_model` | string | profile `model`, else graph `model` | Model override: `"haiku"`, `"sonnet"`, `"opus"`, or full model ID. For an agent node the order is node `llm_model`, the profile's `model`, the graph's `model`. |
| `llm_provider` | string | -- | Required whenever the resolved handler consumes a provider. Not needed when `agent` is set. Values: `"claude"`, `"codex"`, `"gemini"`; aliases: `anthropic`, `openai`, `google` (case-insensitive). `claude` runs the agent profile `claude`. |
| `reasoning_effort` | string | profile `reasoning` | Reasoning level, filled into the profile's `reasoning_args` (built-in `claude`: `--effort <level>`). An error on a profile without `reasoning_args`, and on Codex and Gemini nodes, which have no profile yet. Also accepted in a stylesheet. |
| `allowed_tools` | string | all | Claude-only tool list, e.g. `"Read,Grep,Glob"` or `"Bash(git:*)"`; rejected outside Claude-backed codergen nodes |
| `max_budget_usd` | string | unlimited | Claude-only spend cap for this node's session; rejected outside Claude-backed codergen nodes |
| `goal_gate` | boolean | false | Must succeed for pipeline completion |
| `retry_target` | string | -- | Non-terminal node to loop back to on goal gate failure |
| `fallback_retry_target` | string | -- | Second-level non-terminal retry target |
| `max_retries` | integer | 0 | Additional retryable handler attempts per visit; `N` allows `N + 1` attempts |
| `fidelity` | string | `full` if the agent profile can resume, else `fresh` | Agent nodes only. `full`: a retry or a revisit continues the agent's session for the node's thread; `fresh`: a new session every time. `fidelity="full"` on a profile that can't resume (e.g. `gemini`) fails validation |
| `thread_id` | string | the node id | Agent nodes only. Nodes with the same `thread_id` share one agent session; they must use the same agent profile |
| `timeout` | duration | -- | Deadline around each handler attempt: `120s`, `600s`, `15m`, `1h` |
| `tool_command` | string | -- | Shell command for `parallelogram` nodes |
| `class` | string | -- | Space-separated class list for stylesheet matching |

### Reserved graph attributes

Top-level graph attributes are workflow defaults, not run policy. The names
`dry_run`, `workdir`, `max_steps`, `max_budget_usd`, `quality_disabled`,
`quality_max_fix_iterations`, `outcome`, and `preferred_label` are reserved,
as are the `codergen.claude.*`, `__pas.*`, and `__pas::*` namespaces. A graph
using one fails during `RunConfiguration` preparation. Handler context updates
to these names also fail closed, and legacy checkpoints have them filtered on
restore. Ordinary graph values such as `goal`, `language`, and `deploy_env`
remain available to prompt transforms and workflow Context.

The node attribute `max_budget_usd` is still allowed as a per-session Claude
cap; it is distinct from the reserved top-level global budget control.

### Unsupported execution capabilities

Node attributes `auto_status` and `allow_partial`, a node `fidelity` other than `full` or `fresh` (`truncate`, `compact`, `summary:*`), `fidelity` or `thread_id` on a node that runs no agent, and the edge attributes `fidelity` and `thread_id` are recognized only so canonical compilation can reject them with `unsupported_execution_capability`. They have no runtime semantics. `reasoning_effort` and `agent` are rejected the same way on a node that has no agent profile (Codex and Gemini nodes, and nodes that run no agent). Manager-loop shapes/types are likewise rejected. See [Execution capability contract](execution-capabilities.md).

Compatibility aliases are accepted at the semantic compilation boundary: `node_type` or
`handler` for `type`, `stylesheet` for `model_stylesheet`, and `classes` for `class`.
If canonical and compatibility spellings are both present with different values,
compilation fails with a typed `ConflictingAttributeAliases` diagnostic.

## Canonical semantic compilation

After parsing and DOT-default resolution, PAS normalizes aliases, applies stylesheets,
expands prompt variables, and compiles one immutable `ExecutionPlan`. Validation,
preflight, handler dispatch, provider selection, start/exit recognition, and execution
all consume that plan. They do not independently reinterpret shape or provider strings.

Runtime compilation is fail-closed. Unknown shapes without an explicit registered
handler, unknown handlers/providers, conflicting role signals, missing providers on
`codergen` nodes, and ambiguous start/exit cardinality prevent execution before logs,
checkpoints, handlers, or provider CLIs start. `pas generate` and `pas scaffold` may
insert an explicit Claude provider into generated source, then recompile it strictly.
A registered custom handler may use an omitted or otherwise unknown custom shape; it
cannot override a known built-in role shape without producing
`ConflictingRoleSignals`. The two built-in Beads handlers are the exception: each may
also carry the one shape the spec gives it (see [Beads handlers](#beads-handlers)).

Exactly one start and one exit are required. `shape="Mdiamond"` and
`shape="Msquare"` are canonical. For compatibility, a node whose shape and type are
both omitted may use case-insensitive ID `start` for start or `exit`, `end`, or `done`
for exit. Combining a magic ID with incompatible shape/type signals is an error.

## Beads handlers

`beads.select` and `beads.close` claim and close Tasks of a Beads Epic. Neither
consumes a provider, so neither takes `llm_provider`. String values must be quoted.

```dot
pick_task  [shape="diamond", type="beads.select", epic="e-1", order="e-1.3,e-1.2"]
close_task [shape="box", type="beads.close", require_upstream=true]
pick_task -> implement [label="MORE", condition="preferred_label=MORE"]
pick_task -> done      [label="DONE", condition="preferred_label=DONE"]
```

| Handler | Shape | Attributes |
|---------|-------|------------|
| `beads.select` | `diamond` or none | `epic` (required, non-empty string), `order`, `exclude` (comma lists of Task IDs). Routes with `preferred_label` `MORE`, `DONE` or `BLOCKED`. |
| `beads.close` | `box` or none | `require_upstream` (default `true`), `reason` (template). |

Any other known shape is a `ConflictingRoleSignals` error. A `beads.select` node
without `epic` fails compilation with the node-scoped `attribute_required` rule.
`pas validate` and `pas run` (except `--dry-run`) also report one node-scoped
`beads_available` error per Beads node when `bd` is not on `PATH`, so the Run fails
before it starts. Pipelines without Beads nodes never look at `PATH`.

## Edge Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `label` | string | -- | Display label and preferred_label matching |
| `condition` | string | -- | Condition expression, e.g. `"preferred_label=PASS"`, `"outcome=success"` |
| `weight` | integer | 0 | Higher = preferred when multiple edges match |
| `loop_restart` | boolean | false | Clear completed nodes/outcomes (for back-edges in loops) |
| `reset_quality_loop_state` | boolean | false | Clear quality retry counters and failure footprints. Set on outer work-cycle transitions so a completed task's consumed `max_fix_iterations` budget does not leak into the next task |

## Graph Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `label` | string | Pipeline display name |
| `goal` | string | Pipeline goal description (used by goal gates) |
| `model` | string | Default LLM model for all nodes |

## Common Pipeline Patterns

### Work + verify loop

```dot
work_step [
    shape="box"
    llm_provider="claude"
    label="Implement Feature"
    timeout=900s
    prompt="Implement the feature described in .pas/current_task.md"
]

verify_step [
    shape="diamond"
    llm_provider="claude"
    label="Verify"
    node_type="conditional"
    timeout=600s
    prompt="Check the implementation. Respond PASS or FAIL on the last line."
]

fixup [
    shape="box"
    llm_provider="claude"
    label="Fix Issues"
    timeout=600s
    prompt="Fix the problems found during verification."
]

work_step -> verify_step
verify_step -> next_step [label="PASS", condition="preferred_label=PASS"]
verify_step -> fixup [label="FAIL", condition="preferred_label=FAIL"]
fixup -> verify_step [loop_restart=true]
```

### Tool node (shell command)

```dot
run_tests [
    shape="parallelogram"
    label="Run Tests"
    timeout=300s
    tool_command="cargo test --workspace"
]
```

### Human gate (use sparingly)

Only for decisions that genuinely require human judgment -- not for automatable checks:

```dot
design_review [
    shape="hexagon"
    label="Design Review"
    node_type="wait.human"
    prompt="Review the proposed architecture. Approve to continue or reject to revise."
]
```

### Commit step (required as final work node)

```dot
commit_changes [
    shape="box"
    llm_provider="claude"
    label="Commit Changes"
    timeout=120s
    allowed_tools="Bash(git:*)"
    prompt="Stage and commit all changes made by this pipeline.
1. Run git diff --stat to review what changed
2. Stage the changed files: git add -A
3. Commit with a descriptive message"
]
```

## Validation Rules

`pas validate <file>` first compiles canonical semantics, then applies nine
structural checks. The enforced contract is:

Canonical compilation requires one start and exit; compatible role signals and
aliases; valid typed execution attributes; known handlers/providers; explicit
providers for provider-consuming handlers; and supported capabilities/topology.
Compilation failures are errors. The nine structural checks then enforce:

1. Every edge target exists.
2. Every edge condition parses.
3. Retry and fallback targets name existing nodes.
4. Retry and fallback targets do not resolve to terminal nodes.
5. Goal gates name a retry target.
6. The start has no incoming edge.
7. Exits have no outgoing edge.
8. Every node is reachable from the start.
9. A `codergen` node has a prompt or a descriptive label.

Edge, condition, direction, reachability, and terminal retry-target findings are errors.
Missing retry targets, goal-gate retry declarations, and prompt findings are warnings. Missing timeouts and provider cost limitations
are runtime preflight warnings, not static validation errors. The validator does
not currently enforce tool-command cardinality, conditional fan-out cardinality,
exit reachability from every node, or `loop_restart` guidance.
