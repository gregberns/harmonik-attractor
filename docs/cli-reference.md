## Commands

### `run` — Execute a pipeline

Parses the DOT file, compiles and validates canonical semantics, then executes the
pipeline. Each provider-backed `codergen` node starts its explicitly selected
local Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI.

```
pas run <PIPELINE> [OPTIONS]
```

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PIPELINE` | Yes | Path to the `.dot` pipeline file |

#### Options

| Option | Short | Default | Description |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--workdir <DIR>` | `-w` | current directory | The source directory. In a git repository the Run works in its own worktree (see [Worktree and branch](#worktree-and-branch)), in the same subdirectory as `--workdir`; file paths in prompts are relative to it. |
| `--logs <DIR>` | `-l` | `.pas/logs` | Directory for log output. |
| `--base <REF>` | — | `HEAD` | Commit, branch or tag a new Run's branch starts at. Ignored on resume. |
| `--worktree-root <DIR>` | — | `[run] worktree_root` in `pas.toml`, else `<project-root>/.pas/worktrees` | Folder for the Runs' worktrees; each Run's is `<DIR>/<run-id>`. Relative to the current directory. Ignored on resume. |
| `--dry-run` | — | false | Parse and validate the pipeline without executing provider processes or tools; no cost is incurred. |
| `--max-budget-usd <AMOUNT>` | — | $200 | Maximum tracked spend across all nodes. Pipeline aborts with an error if exceeded. Codex and Gemini CLI calls report no dollar cost and therefore do not count toward this limit; use `--max-steps` to bound them. |
| `--max-steps <COUNT>` | — | 200 | Maximum number of node executions before aborting. Prevents runaway loops. A 6-node pipeline that loops 3 times = 18 steps. |
| `--fresh` | — | false | Discard any saved checkpoint and start from the beginning. By default, re-running the same command resumes from the last completed node. |
| `--codergen-claude-settings-mode <MODE>` | — | `subscription-bare` | Claude settings mode for `codergen` nodes: `subscription-bare`, `strict-bare`, or `inherit`. |
| `--codergen-claude-setting-sources <LIST>` | — | — | Comma-separated Claude setting sources for `inherit` mode (`user,project,local`). Required when inheriting. |
| `--codergen-claude-settings <JSON_OR_FILE>` | — | — | PAS-owned Claude settings JSON or file path for `codergen` nodes. Does not imply user settings inheritance. |
| `--codergen-claude-tools <TOOLS>` | — | Claude default | Explicit Claude built-in tool surface for `codergen` nodes, e.g. `Read,Edit` or `""` to disable built-ins. |
| `--codergen-claude-agents <JSON>` | — | — | PAS-owned Claude agents JSON for `codergen` nodes. |
| `--codergen-claude-plugin-dir <DIR>` | — | — | PAS-owned Claude plugin directory for `codergen` nodes. Repeatable. |
| `--codergen-claude-mcp-config <JSON_OR_FILE>` | — | none | Explicit MCP config for `codergen` nodes. `--strict-mcp-config` remains enabled. |
| `--run-id <UUID>` | — | generated (UUID v7) | Use this Run ID instead of generating one. Must be a UUID; anything else is rejected. The Monitor passes it so it knows the ID before the Run starts. |
| `--json` | — | false | Print `{"v":1,"ok":true,"run_id","run_dir"}` as the first stdout line once the Run folder exists, and the Run's [`final.json`](#end-of-run-finaljson) object as the last stdout line when the Run ends (success, failure, stop or SIGTERM); all other output goes to stderr. A setup failure before the first line prints only `{"v":1,"ok":false,"error":…}`. |
| `--allow-test-agents` | — | false | Allow agent profiles marked `test_only` (the test fakes). Without it, a pipeline using one fails before it starts, naming the node. |
| `--allow-shared-workdir` | — | false | Start even if another process is working in this Run's worktree. Each Run has its own worktree, so this only matters when the same Run is resumed twice at once (e.g. with another `--logs`). The Run records `shared_workdir: true` in its `RunStarted` event when it actually shares the worktree. |

PAS resolves each run-control field independently using `caller > manifest > permitted graph defaults > built-ins`.
Graph defaults are permitted only for workflow semantics and the quality node's
`max_fix_iterations`; graphs cannot author global `dry_run`, `workdir`,
`max_steps`, `max_budget_usd`, `quality_disabled`,
`quality_max_fix_iterations`, or `codergen.claude.*` controls. CLI/API values
remain authoritative. Invalid typed controls and reserved graph attributes fail
before provider/tool startup, log creation, or before `--fresh` deletes a checkpoint.

The built-ins are `dry_run=false`, `max_steps=200`, a $200 tracked global
budget, the canonical current directory, quality enabled, three quality-fix
iterations, and Claude `subscription_bare` isolation. A node-level
`max_budget_usd` remains a separate per-Claude-session cap.

#### Worktree and branch

When `--workdir` is inside a git repository, each Run works in its own git worktree on its own branch, and the main checkout is never changed:

- **Branch:** `pas/run/<run-id>`, started at `--base` (default `HEAD`). An unknown or unborn base is refused with exit 1 (`invalid_base`) before any branch or worktree is created.
- **Worktree:** `<worktree-root>/<run-id>`. The root is `--worktree-root`, else `[run] worktree_root` in `pas.toml` (relative to the `pas.toml`'s folder), else `<project-root>/.pas/worktrees`, where the project root is `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` of `--workdir`:

  ```toml
  [run]
  worktree_root = "../pas-worktrees"
  ```

- **Subdirectory:** if `--workdir` is a subdirectory of the repository, agents and tool nodes run in the same subdirectory of the worktree. `pas.toml` is still read from the source checkout.
- **Dirty checkout:** uncommitted changes and untracked files in the main checkout (outside `.pas/`) are not in the worktree. A new Run still starts, and prints a warning that is also recorded in `run.json` and the `RunStarted` event's `warnings`.
- **`.pas/.gitignore`:** a new Run writes a `.gitignore` containing `*` in `<project-root>/.pas` (default worktree root), in a custom worktree root, and in the `.pas` folder of the default logs (when `--logs` is not given), so `git status` in the main checkout stays clean and pas's own files never count as uncommitted changes. An existing `.gitignore` there is never changed.
- **Resume:** re-running the command resumes in the worktree and branch recorded in `run.json`, whatever `--base`, `--worktree-root` or `pas.toml` now say; each differing setting prints a warning. `run.json` is not rewritten.
- **`--fresh`** starts a new Run with a new worktree and branch. The old worktree and branch stay; removing them is not done yet.
- **Attempt commits:** after every attempt of every node except start and exit nodes, whatever its result, PAS commits everything in the worktree except `.pas/` (`git add -A -- . ':(exclude).pas'`, then `git commit --allow-empty --no-verify` with `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`, so none of the repository's hooks run, and with `commit.gpgsign=false`: attempt commits are never signed, since signing could prompt or fail in an unattended Run). The agent's own commits during the attempt stay, with PAS's commit on top. The message is `pas(<run-id>): <node> attempt <n> (<status>)` with the trailers `Pas-Run`, `Pas-Node`, `Pas-Attempt`, `Pas-Status` (`success`, `fail`, `retry` or `interrupted`) and, for a failure, `Pas-Failure-Class` (`reported`, `timeout`, `crash`, `no_result` or `launch`). If the repository has no `user.name`/`user.email`, the commit is made as `PAS <pas@localhost>`. A Run outside a worktree (not a git repository, or `--dry-run`) makes no commits. If an attempt can't be committed, the Run stops with `node '<id>' attempt <n>: could not commit the attempt: ...`; the changes stay in the worktree and a resume commits them as `interrupted`.
- **Interrupted attempts:** if `pas` ended during an attempt (killed, crashed, or stopped with SIGTERM), a resume first commits what that attempt left (`Pas-Status: interrupted`), when the worktree has changes or the agent committed during it, even if the node has no attempts left. The node's next attempt is told so in its prompt: `Your previous attempt was interrupted; its changes since <start> are recorded in commit <sha>. Review git diff <start> before continuing.`, where `<start>` is the worktree's commit when the interrupted attempt began. An interrupted attempt still counts toward `max_retries`, except one ended by a stop (SIGTERM), which does not. Attempt numbers (`Pas-Attempt`, `PAS_ATTEMPT`) never repeat within a visit of a node: the attempt after an interrupted attempt 1 is attempt 2, whether or not attempt 1 counted.
- **End of run:** when the Run succeeds, its worktree is removed (`git worktree remove`) and its branch stays, so the result is `git log pas/run/<run-id>`. A worktree with uncommitted changes outside `.pas/`, or one another process is working in (`--allow-shared-workdir`), is kept instead, with a warning in `final.json`. A failed or stopped Run keeps both the worktree and the branch, for a resume or a look. The branch is never deleted.
- **Directory mode:** each `.dot` file is its own Run, so each phase gets its own worktree from `--base`, and a phase does not see an earlier phase's edits.
- **Not a git repository** (or `git` not on `PATH`), or **`--dry-run`:** the Run works in `--workdir` itself, as before; outside git it prints a `not a git repository` warning.

`run.json` records `worktree`, `branch`, `base` (the ref as given) and `base_sha` for a Run in a worktree, and `warnings`. Its `workdir` stays the source directory.

#### Concurrency locks

Each Attempt holds two exclusive, non-blocking `flock` locks until it ends. Both lock files contain `{"pid":…,"run_id":…}` for the Run that holds them.

- **Pipeline lock:** `run.lock` in the Pipeline's logs folder. A second `pas run` of the same Pipeline exits with code 5: `error: pipeline already running (pid 1234, run 0192...)`. `--allow-shared-workdir` does not override this.
- **Worktree lock:** `pas-run.lock` in the Run's worktree's git dir (`<repo>/.git/worktrees/<run-id>/pas-run.lock`). Since each Run has its own worktree, two Pipelines in one repository both start. A second process working in the same Run's worktree (the same `--run-id` under another `--logs`) exits with code 6 and names the other Run, unless `--allow-shared-workdir` is passed. Outside a git repository, or without `git` on `PATH`, only the Pipeline lock is taken.

The Pipeline lock is taken before the checkpoint is read and before any branch or worktree is created; the Worktree lock is taken once the Run's worktree exists. A refused Run creates no Run folder or Run Index entry. With `--json`, the refusal is printed as `{"v":1,"ok":false,"error":{"code":"pipeline_locked"|"worktree_locked","message":…}}`. The OS releases both locks when the process exits, even after `kill -9`, so no cleanup is needed. A Pipeline whose stages call `pas run` in the same worktree needs `--allow-shared-workdir` on the inner `pas run`.

#### Run folder layout

Every Run writes a Run Journal under its Pipeline's logs folder and registers in the Run Index (`$PAS_STATE_DIR/runs.jsonl`, see [Environment](#environment)):

```
<logs>/<stem>-<hash>/          the Pipeline folder
  checkpoint.json
  run.lock                     Pipeline lock
  runs/<run-id>/
    run.json                   Run metadata
    events.jsonl               Events (Run Journal)
    console.log
    transcripts/<invocation-id>.jsonl   one per Model Invocation
    transcripts/<invocation-id>.stderr.log  its stderr (Claude nodes)
    transcripts/<invocation-id>.prompt.txt  its prompt, argv and env names
    answers/<question-id>.json          Human Gate answers
    control/stop                        stop request
    final.json                          end-of-run report
```

Every file and event, its format, when it is written and its version field: [run-folder.md](run-folder.md).

#### End of run: `final.json`

Every end the `pas run` process lives through writes `runs/<run-id>/final.json` (atomically: a temp file, then a rename), after `AttemptEnded`: success, failure, a stop between stages, and SIGTERM (exit 143). A SIGKILL writes none. Each Attempt overwrites it, so it describes the latest end. With `--json` the same object, on one line, is the last stdout line.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "run_id": "0192a3b4-c5d6-7e8f-9a0b-1c2d3e4f5a6b",
  "status": "failed",
  "branch": "pas/run/0192a3b4-c5d6-7e8f-9a0b-1c2d3e4f5a6b",
  "base": "HEAD",
  "base_sha": "4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904",
  "final_commit": "9fceb02d0ae598e95dc970b74767f19372d61af8",
  "worktree": "/repo/.pas/worktrees/0192a3b4-c5d6-7e8f-9a0b-1c2d3e4f5a6b",
  "error": "Handler 'codergen' failed on node 'work': …",
  "warnings": []
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `v` | Format version, `1` |
| `run_id` | The Run |
| `status` | `success`, `failed`, or `stopped` (a stop between stages or SIGTERM; the Run can resume) |
| `branch`, `base`, `base_sha` | As in `run.json`; `null` without a worktree (not a git repository, or `--dry-run`) |
| `final_commit` | `git rev-parse <branch>` at the end: the last attempt commit; `null` without a worktree |
| `worktree` | The kept worktree's path; `null` when it was removed (a successful Run) or there is none |
| `error` | The Run's error text, as printed on stderr; only when `status` is `failed` |
| `warnings` | Problems at the end that did not change the result, e.g. a worktree kept because of uncommitted changes, or a removal that failed |

#### Directory mode

When `PIPELINE` is a directory, `run` collects all `*.dot` files and executes them sequentially in lexical order. Use zero-padded names to control execution order (`phase-01.dot`, `phase-02.dot`, `phase-11.dot`). Checkpoints apply per-pipeline within the run. Each Pipeline takes and releases its own locks.

#### Output

Prints:
- Pipeline name and goal
- Working directory (the Run's worktree, in a git repository)
- Per-node log lines with node ID, label, turns, cost, and error status
- List of completed nodes
- Total cost across all nodes

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Pipeline completed successfully, or a stop request (`pas stop`) ended the Run between stages |
| 1 | Pipeline failed (validation error, handler error, goal gate unsatisfied, or quality loop exhausted) |
| 2 | `pas.toml` found but not trusted — run `pas trust add` or set `PAS_TRUST_THIS=1` |
| 5 | The Pipeline is already running (another Run holds its Pipeline lock) |
| 6 | Another process is working in this Run's git worktree and `--allow-shared-workdir` was not passed |

#### Quality manifest warnings

If a pipeline contains a `quality` node but no `pas.toml` is found in the working directory tree, `pas run` emits a `[WARN]` preflight diagnostic and continues. Stages will use the node's `quality_checks` attribute as a fallback; the manifest-driven stage list (`[quality.stages]`) is unavailable.

To suppress the warning, run `pas init` in your project root to generate a `pas.toml`.

#### Provider CLI versions

`codergen` nodes read each provider's streaming output. These are the minimum
supported provider CLI versions:

| Provider CLI | Minimum supported version | Output flag PAS passes | What PAS reads from the stream |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Claude Code (`claude`) | 2.1.282 | `--output-format stream-json --verbose` | Final text, actual model, input and output tokens, cost |
| Codex CLI (`codex`) | 0.151.0 | `exec --json` | Final text, input and output tokens. Codex reports no model name and no cost. |
| Gemini CLI (`gemini`) | 0.11.0 for `stream-json`; older versions use `json` | `--output-format stream-json`, or `--output-format json` when `gemini --help` does not list `stream-json` | Final text, actual model, input and output tokens. Gemini reports no cost. |

- The Claude Code and Codex CLI minimums are the versions PAS was verified
  against. Older versions may work but are not supported.
- Gemini CLI 0.11.0 is the first release with `--output-format stream-json`.
  PAS runs the profile's whole command with `--help` once per command per
  `pas` process to check for it, as it runs the agent: in the workdir, with
  the agent's environment, stdin from `/dev/null`, in its own process group
  (killed after 10 s). If the check fails for any reason, PAS uses
  `--output-format json`.
- Input tokens include cached prompt tokens for every provider.
- A value the provider does not report is recorded as unknown. A missing value
  never fails the stage.

#### Claude settings isolation for `codergen`

Claude-backed `codergen` nodes run in PAS-controlled isolation by default. PAS passes Claude Code `--safe-mode`, `--strict-mcp-config`, and `--disable-slash-commands` so subscription auth still works while personal hooks, skills, plugins, MCP servers, and other ambient Claude Code customizations are suppressed as much as Claude allows without literal bare mode.

Modes:

| Mode | Claude behavior | Auth impact |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| `subscription-bare` | Default. Uses `--safe-mode` plus PAS-owned explicit settings/tools/agents/plugins/MCP when configured. | Works with normal Claude subscription auth. |
| `strict-bare` | Uses Claude's literal `--bare`. Strongest isolation. | Requires API-key/auth-helper-compatible Claude auth; normal subscription OAuth/keychain auth is not read. |
| `inherit` | Does not pass `--safe-mode` or `--bare`; loads explicit `--setting-sources`. | Personal hooks/settings may run. Opt in loudly. |

Equivalent `pas.toml` config:

```toml
[codergen.claude]
settings_mode = "subscription_bare" # subscription_bare | strict_bare | inherit
setting_sources = ["user"]           # only for inherit
settings_json = "{\"enabledPlugins\":{}}"
tools = "Read,Edit"
agents_json = "{}"
plugin_dirs = [".pas/claude-plugin"]
mcp_config_json = "{}"
```

CLI flags override the corresponding `pas.toml` field for the current run;
unset CLI fields continue to inherit their individual manifest values.

These settings are added to the end of the `claude` profile's `args` (below),
before `inherit_from` is resolved, so a profile that inherits from `claude`
gets them too. The argv is the same as before profiles existed.

#### Agent profiles (`[agents.<name>]` in `pas.toml`)

A codergen node runs through a named **agent profile**: `agent="<profile>"`
on the node, or `llm_provider`, which names a built-in profile:
`claude`/`anthropic` is `claude`, `codex`/`openai` is `codex`,
`gemini`/`google` is `gemini`. PAS ships these three in its built-in
`agents.toml`:

| Profile | Mechanism (handler) | Command and args | The handler adds |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| `claude` | `claude-p` | `claude --no-session-persistence --dangerously-skip-permissions --strict-mcp-config --disable-slash-commands` (+ `[codergen.claude]` flags) | `-p <prompt> --output-format stream-json --verbose` |
| `codex` | `codex-exec` | `codex exec --json --yolo --skip-git-repo-check --ephemeral` | `--cd <workdir> <prompt>` |
| `gemini` | `gemini` | `gemini --approval-mode yolo` | `--output-format <json\|stream-json>` right after the command, and `<prompt>` last |

A model is added as `--model <model>` for all three; only `claude` takes a
reasoning level (`--effort <level>`). Every agent node runs the same way:
stdin is `/dev/null`, the environment is the profile's (below; the
`PAS_*` ids are added), stdout and stderr go to the Run's `transcripts/`,
and a timeout or stop gets TERM, `kill_grace`, then KILL. `LlmInvoked`
records the profile name as `provider`.

> **Codex and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.** The default `env.remove` strips
> `OPENAI_API_KEY`, so Codex bills the logged-in subscription, never an
> inherited API key. A project that logs Codex in with an API key adds a
> profile that sets it, and selects it with `agent="codex-api"`:
>
> ```toml
> [agents.codex-api]
> inherit_from = "codex"
> env.set = { OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..." }
> ```

A project replaces a profile by name, or adds one, in `pas.toml`:

```toml
[agents.claude-opus]
inherit_from = "claude"
model = "opus"
kill_grace = "20s"

[agents.fake]
mechanism = "claude-p"
command = "/abs/path/to/tests/agents/fake-claude"
test_only = true
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `mechanism` | The handler that drives the agent; today only `claude-p` (`claude -p`, stream-json). Required. |
| `command` | The program, as a string or a list (`["claude", "--sub"]`). Required. |
| `args` | Arguments after `command`. |
| `model` | The model when the node sets no `llm_model`. |
| `model_args` | Added when a model is selected; `{model}` is replaced, e.g. `["--model", "{model}"]`. |
| `reasoning` | The reasoning level when the node sets no `reasoning_effort`. |
| `reasoning_args` | Added when a reasoning level is selected; `{reasoning}` is replaced, e.g. `["--effort", "{reasoning}"]`. Without it, a reasoning level is an error. |
| `timeout` | How long an invocation may run when the node sets no `timeout` (built-in `10m`). |
| `kill_grace` | How long to wait after TERM before KILL, on timeout or stop (built-in `10s`). |
| `env.remove` | Variables removed from the agent's environment. |
| `env.set` | Variables set in the agent's environment, after `env.remove`; the `PAS_*` ids are set last. |
| `test_only` | Refused unless `pas run` / `pas validate` get `--allow-test-agents`. |
| `inherit_from` | Another profile to take every field this one leaves unset from. |

Resolution: a `pas.toml` profile replaces the built-in profile of the same
name whole. Then `inherit_from` is followed field by field: a field the
profile sets replaces the parent's whole value (lists are not merged).
Last, the built-in defaults fill any field still unset: `timeout = "10m"`,
`kill_grace = "10s"` and the `env.remove` list below. An unknown field, an
unknown or cyclic `inherit_from`, a missing `mechanism` or `command`, or a
bad duration fails `pas run` and `pas validate`, naming the profile.

> **Warning.** A profile that sets its own `env.remove` replaces the default
> list, so `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` then reaches the agent unless the profile
> lists it too. The default list is:
>
> ```toml
> env.remove = ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN", "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL",
>               "OPENAI_API_KEY", "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK", "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX"]
> ```

On a node, `llm_model` beats the profile's `model`, which beats the graph's
`model`; `reasoning_effort` beats the profile's `reasoning`; `timeout` beats
the profile's `timeout`. `pas run` and `pas validate` check every profile a
pipeline uses before anything starts, and name the node: an unknown profile,
a reasoning level on a profile without `reasoning_args`, or a `test_only`
profile without `--allow-test-agents`.

### `runs` — List Runs

Lists every Run in the Run Index (`runs.jsonl` in `$PAS_STATE_DIR`, else
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/pas`, else `~/.local/state/pas`) in start order, each with a
status derived from its Run Journal. The Index never stores a status.
`pas runs` only reads: it takes no Run lock, so it never makes a starting
`pas run` exit with 5 or 6.

```
pas runs [--active] [--json]
```

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--active` | Only list Runs whose status is `running` |
| `--json` | Print one JSON object on stdout (see below) |

#### Statuses

The last Attempt of the Run decides:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `completed` | The last Attempt ended with reason `completed` |
| `stopped` | The last Attempt ended with reason `stopped` |
| `failed` | The last Attempt ended with reason `failed`, `error`, `budget_exhausted`, or `max_steps` |
| `crashed` | The last Attempt has no `AttemptEnded`, its last sign of life is more than 2 minutes old, and its PID is not alive |
| `running` | The last Attempt has no `AttemptEnded` and is not `crashed` |
| `missing` | The Run folder (`run_dir`) no longer exists |

The last sign of life is the Attempt's last `Heartbeat` (written every 30 s),
else its `AttemptStarted`, else the Index `started_at`. The PID comes from the
same Event; when none is known it counts as not alive. So a Run killed with
`kill -9` shows `running` for up to 2 minutes, then `crashed`.

A Run Journal that cannot be read prints a warning on stderr; the Run is
still listed, with its status derived as if the journal had no Events.

#### Output

```
RUN ID                                STATUS     STARTED               PIPELINE                 WORKDIR
0192a3b4-...                          completed  2026-09-24T10:00:00Z  /abs/pipelines/x.dot     /abs/repo
0192a3c5-...                          running    2026-09-24T11:30:12Z  /abs/pipelines/y.dot     /abs/repo
```

With no Runs it prints `(no runs)` (`(no active runs)` with `--active`).

With `--json`, stdout is exactly one object. Each Run is its Index entry
plus `status`:

```json
{"v":1,"ok":true,"runs":[{"v":1,"run_id":"0192...","started_at":"2026-09-24T10:00:00Z","workdir":"/abs/repo","pipeline_path":"/abs/pipelines/x.dot","run_dir":"/abs/repo/.pas/logs/x-1a2b3c4d/runs/0192...","status":"completed"}]}
```

An empty or absent Index gives `{"v":1,"ok":true,"runs":[]}`. If the Index
exists but cannot be read, stdout is
`{"v":1,"ok":false,"error":{"code":"index_unreadable","message":"..."}}`.

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Listed (including an empty or absent Index, and `missing` Runs) |
| 1 | The Run Index exists but cannot be read |

---

### `answer` — Answer a waiting Human Gate

Creates the answer file of a Human Gate question. The waiting `pas run` picks
it up, journals `HumanInputAnswered` with the file's `source`, and continues.
`pas answer` finds the Run through the Run Index, takes no Run lock, and never
writes the Run Journal.

```
pas answer <run-id> <question-id> <choice> [--source cli|monitor] [--json]
```

- `<question-id>` is the `question_id` of the Run's `HumanInputRequested` Event.
- `<choice>` must equal one of that Event's `choices` (an edge label) exactly;
  numbers are not accepted.
- `--source` (default `cli`) is recorded as the answer's source. `terminal` is
  reserved for `pas run` itself.

The file is `<run-dir>/answers/<question-id>.json`, created exclusively, so the
first answer wins and an existing file is never changed:

```json
{"v":1,"question_id":"q-review-1","choice":"approve","source":"cli","answered_at":"2026-09-24T10:00:00Z"}
```

With `--json`, stdout is exactly one object. Success:

```json
{"v":1,"ok":true,"run_id":"0192...","question_id":"q-review-1","choice":"approve","source":"cli","answer_path":"/abs/.../answers/q-review-1.json"}
```

Failure (`run_id` is echoed as typed):

```json
{"v":1,"ok":false,"run_id":"0192...","error":{"code":"invalid_choice","message":"..."}}
```

Error codes: `unknown_run`, `run_missing`, `unknown_question`,
`invalid_choice`, `already_answered`, `io_error`.

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Answer file created |
| 1 | Any other failure; no file is created |
| 7 | The question is already answered; the existing file is unchanged |

---

### `stop` — Stop an active Run after its current stage

```
pas stop <run-id> [--source cli|monitor] [--json]
```

Creates `<logs>/runs/<run-id>/control/stop`. The running `pas run` checks for the file before each stage. The stage in progress always finishes. Then the Run journals `StopRequested`, saves a checkpoint at the next node, journals `AttemptEnded` with reason `stopped`, and exits 0. Its status is `stopped`.

Run the same `pas run` command again to resume. The resume starts at the next node without repeating the finished stage, and removes the stop file first. A stop file left over from an earlier Attempt never stops a new one. In directory mode a stopped pipeline halts the batch; rerun to resume it.

`pas stop` never writes the journal and takes no lock. The stop file is JSON, `{"v":1,"source":"cli","requested_at":"..."}`; an unreadable file still stops the Run, with source `cli`. A second `pas stop` succeeds and leaves the first file unchanged.

A Run waiting at a Human Gate does not check for a stop until the gate is answered. If the Run ends between the status check and the file write, the stale file is removed by the next Attempt.

#### Options

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--source cli\|monitor` | Who is stopping; recorded in `StopRequested` (default `cli`) |
| `--json` | Print one JSON object |

#### Output

Success: `{"v":1,"ok":true,"run_id":"…","stop_path":"…","already_requested":false}`. Failure: `{"v":1,"ok":false,"run_id":"<as typed>","error":{"code":"…","message":"…"}}`. Codes: `unknown_run`, `run_missing`, `not_active` (the Run's status is not `running`; the message says `run <id> is not active (status: …)`), `io_error`.

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Stop requested (or already requested) |
| 1 | Any failure; no file is created |

### `kill` — End an active Run now

```
pas kill <run-id> [--grace <duration>] [--json]
```

Ends a `running` Run immediately. `pas kill` takes the PID of the Run's last Heartbeat (else its `AttemptStarted`) and signals it only if that PID provably is the Run: the Pipeline lock (`run.lock`) must be held right now, and the lock file must name that PID and this Run. Otherwise it sends no signal and fails with `pid_not_lock_holder`. A Run that is not `running` fails with `not_active`, also without a signal.

It sends SIGTERM to the Run's process group (only when the Run leads its group; otherwise to the PID alone). A `pas run` handles SIGTERM by stopping its current stage (an agent gets TERM, its profile's `kill_grace`, then KILL; other stage children are killed), journaling `AttemptEnded` with reason `stopped`, and exiting. If the process is still alive after `--grace`, `pas kill` sends SIGKILL to the Run and to the process groups of its child processes (provider CLIs and tool commands run in their own groups). A SIGKILLed Run writes no `AttemptEnded`, so its status becomes `crashed` once its Heartbeat is stale. The checkpoint of the last completed stage is kept: run the same `pas run` command again to resume, which repeats the stage that was in progress.

`pas kill` never writes the journal and takes no lock beyond a momentary probe. Use `pas stop` to end a Run cleanly after its current stage.

#### Options

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--grace <duration>` | Time between SIGTERM and SIGKILL, e.g. `500ms`, `10s`, `1m`. Default: 5 s longer than a stopped Run waits for its agents, so the Run still journals `AttemptEnded`. That wait is recorded in the Attempt's `AttemptStarted` as `stop_wait_ms`: the longest `kill_grace` of the profiles the pipeline uses, plus 5 s (15 s with the built-in profile, so the default is 20 s). A Run that recorded none gets 20 s. The Monitor's kill uses this default. |
| `--json` | Print one JSON object |

#### Output

Success: `{"v":1,"ok":true,"run_id":"…","pid":123,"signal":"SIGTERM","children_killed":0}`. `signal` is the signal that ended the Run; `children_killed` counts child process groups killed on the SIGKILL path. Failure: `{"v":1,"ok":false,"run_id":"<as typed>","error":{"code":"…","message":"…"}}`. Codes: `unknown_run`, `run_missing`, `not_active`, `no_pid`, `pid_not_lock_holder`, `invalid_grace`, `kill_failed` (still alive one second after SIGKILL), `io_error`.

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | The Run process ended |
| 1 | Any failure |

### `monitor` — Serve the Monitor web UI

Available only when built with `--features monitor` (`install.sh` does this).

```
pas monitor [--port 7777] [--open]
```

#### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--port <PORT>` | 7777 | Port to listen on (`127.0.0.1` only). |
| `--open` | false | Open the default browser once listening. |

Binds `127.0.0.1` only; the address cannot be changed. Every request must carry
a loopback `Host` (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`) and any `Origin` must be
loopback too, otherwise the server answers 403. State-changing requests also
need the per-process CSRF token (`X-CSRF-Token`). Assets are embedded in the
binary and need no network.

The Monitor observes Runs only through Run Journals and the Run Index, so a
Run started in any terminal appears without configuration. It controls Runs
with the same files `pas stop` and `pas answer` write. It plans and launches
Runs by spawning the `pas` binary, never by linking the engine (ADR 0001,
ADR 0002). Uploaded Plans are stored under `$PAS_STATE_DIR/plans/<plan-id>/`.
A Plan runs in reviewed mode (Proposal, Epic, Pipeline, then Launch, each
step confirmed) or one-click mode (all steps without pausing, stopping at the
first failure). Without `--features monitor` the subcommand does not exist.

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | The server shut down cleanly |
| 1 | Any failure, including a port already in use (the message names `127.0.0.1:<port>`) |

### Beads handlers

`beads.select` and `beads.close` claim and close Tasks of a Beads Epic inside a Pipeline. Both need `bd` on `PATH`. See [dot-dialect.md](dot-dialect.md#beads-handlers) for validation rules.

| Handler | Attribute | Default | Description |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `beads.select` | `epic` | required | ID of the Epic whose child Tasks are claimed. |
| `beads.select` | `order` | — | Comma list of Task IDs to try first. |
| `beads.select` | `exclude` | — | Comma list of Task IDs to skip. |
| `beads.close` | `require_upstream` | `true` | Only close when the upstream node succeeded. |
| `beads.close` | `reason` | — | Close reason template. |

`beads.select` routes with `preferred_label` `MORE`, `DONE` or `BLOCKED`.

```dot
pick_task  [shape="diamond", type="beads.select", epic="e-1", order="e-1.3,e-1.2"]
close_task [shape="box", type="beads.close", require_upstream=true]
pick_task -> implement [label="MORE", condition="preferred_label=MORE"]
pick_task -> done      [label="DONE", condition="preferred_label=DONE"]
```

### `validate` — Check a pipeline for errors

Runs canonical semantic compilation followed by nine structural checks without
executing the pipeline. Useful for checking typed roles, providers, syntax, and
structure before committing a DOT file.

A Pipeline with `beads.select` or `beads.close` nodes also needs `bd` on `PATH`;
without it, each such node gets a `beads_available` error. A `beads.select` node
without `epic` gets an `attribute_required` error.

```
pas validate <PIPELINE> [--allow-test-agents] [--json]
```

It also checks every agent profile the pipeline uses against the current
directory's project (`pas.toml` and the built-in profiles); see
[Agent profiles](#agent-profiles-agentsname-in-pastoml). A `test_only`
profile is an error unless `--allow-test-agents` is given.

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PIPELINE` | Yes | Path to the `.dot` pipeline file |
| `--allow-test-agents` | No | Allow agent profiles marked `test_only` |
| `--json` | No | Print one JSON object on stdout instead of the human report |

#### JSON output (`--json`)

```
{"v":1,"ok":true,"valid":false,"diagnostics":[{"severity":"error","node_id":"work","message":"...","fix":"..."}]}
```

`diagnostics` lists every validator diagnostic in order; `severity` is `error`,
`warning` or `info`; `node_id` and `fix` appear only when present. `valid` is
false only when an `error` diagnostic exists, so a warnings-only Pipeline is
`valid:true` with diagnostics and exits 0. If the file cannot be read or
parsed, the output is `{"v":1,"ok":false,"error":{"code":"io"|"invalid_dot","message":"..."}}`
with no `valid` key. Any `valid:false` or `ok:false` result exits 1.

#### Output

If valid:
```
Pipeline is valid
```

If issues found:
```
[ERROR] provider_valid (node: analyze): Node 'analyze' has unknown llm_provider 'llama'
  Fix: Use claude/anthropic, codex/openai, or gemini/google
[WARN] prompt_on_llm_nodes (node: review): Node 'review' (handler=codergen) has no prompt and label matches id
  Fix: Add a prompt or a descriptive label attribute
```

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | No errors (warnings are OK) |
| 1 | One or more errors found |

---

### `info` — Inspect a pipeline

Displays the pipeline structure: name, goal, node count, edge count, start/exit nodes, and a list of all nodes with their resolved kind, handler, and provider.

```
pas info <PIPELINE>
```

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PIPELINE` | Yes | Path to the `.dot` pipeline file |

#### Output

```
Pipeline: FixSyncPartialFailure
Goal: Fix baseball-v3-vfd5: sync_player_data silently returns partial results
Nodes: 9
Edges: 9
Start: start (Start)
Exit: done (Done)

Nodes:
  done [Done] kind=Exit handler=exit provider=-
  implement [Implement Fix] kind=Task handler=codergen provider=codex
  start [Start] kind=Start handler=start provider=-
  verify [Verify Quality] kind=Conditional { llm_backed: true } handler=codergen provider=claude
  ...
```

---

### `plan` — Generate PRD or spec documents

Creates a PRD (product requirements document) or technical specification from a template. Optionally uses Claude to generate content from a one-line description.

```
pas plan [OPTIONS]
```

#### Options

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--prd` | One of `--prd`/`--spec` | — | Generate a PRD document |
| `--spec` | One of `--prd`/`--spec` | — | Generate a technical specification |
| `--from-prompt <DESC>` | No | — | Use Claude to generate the document from this description instead of copying the blank template |
| `--output <PATH>` | No | `.pas/prd.md` or `.pas/spec.md` | Output file path |

#### Output

Copies the template or generates content and writes to the output path. Prints next steps for manual editing or beads integration.

#### Examples

```bash
# Copy blank PRD template for manual editing
pas plan --prd

# Generate a PRD from a description
pas plan --prd --from-prompt "Add OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers"

# Generate a spec to a custom path
pas plan --spec --output docs/specs/auth-spec.md
```

---

### `decompose` — Convert spec to beads issues

Reads a technical specification file and uses Claude to generate beads CLI commands that create an epic, child tasks, and dependencies.

```
pas decompose <SPEC_PATH> [OPTIONS]
pas decompose --plan <FILE> [--plan <FILE> ...] [OPTIONS]
pas decompose --from-proposal <FILE> [--json]
```

Exactly one source is required: `SPEC_PATH`, one or more `--plan`, or `--from-proposal`. Combining them is a usage error (exit 2).

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SPEC_PATH` | One source | Path to the spec markdown file |

#### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--plan <FILE>` | | A Plan document (`.md` or `.txt`); repeat for a multi-file Plan (max 20 files, 1 MiB each). Conflicts with `SPEC_PATH` |
| `--from-proposal <FILE>` | | Create exactly the Proposal in this JSON file, with no LLM call. Conflicts with `SPEC_PATH`, `--plan`, `--dry-run` |
| `--dry-run` | false | Print the generated Proposal without creating anything |
| `--json` | false | Print one JSON object on stdout (C6); progress goes to stderr |

#### JSON payloads

- `--dry-run --json`: `{"v":1,"ok":true,"proposal":{"v":1,"epic":{"title","description"},"tasks":[{"title","type","priority","description","acceptance"?,"design"?,"notes"?}],"dependencies":[{"blocked","blocker"}]}}`. Makes no `bd` call.
- Create with `--json`: `{"v":1,"ok":true,"epic_id":"..","task_ids":[".."]}`.
- Failure: `{"v":1,"ok":false,"error":{"code","message"}}` and exit 1. Codes: `invalid_proposal`, `plan_input`, `llm_failed`, `beads_failed`, `bd_not_found`, `io`.

`dependencies` use 0-based Task indices. A Proposal with no Tasks, an out-of-range or self dependency, or `v` other than 1 is rejected before any `bd` call (this also applies to Proposals Claude generates). `--from-proposal` skips the post-create spec coverage check, since there is no spec text.

#### Output

Creates a beads epic with child tasks and dependencies. Prints the epic ID, task count, and dependency count. On `--dry-run`, prints the shell script that would be executed.

#### Examples

```bash
# Preview what would be created
pas decompose .pas/spec.md --dry-run

# Create the epic and tasks
pas decompose .pas/spec.md

# Decompose a spec from a custom path
pas decompose docs/specs/auth-spec.md
```

---

### `generate` — Generate pipeline from spec files

Uses Claude to convert a technical specification (and optional PRD) into a pipeline `.dot` file. Supports single-file and directory modes.

```
pas generate [OPTIONS] <FILE>...
pas generate <DIRECTORY>
```

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FILE` | Yes | Spec file path, or PRD then spec (positional), or a directory of `*-spec.md` files |

#### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--prd <PATH>` | — | Explicit PRD file path |
| `--spec <PATH>` | — | Explicit spec file path |
| `--plan <FILE>` | — | A Plan document (`.md`/`.txt`); repeat for an ordered multi-file Plan. Conflicts with positional files, `--prd` and `--spec`. Default output is `pipelines/<stem of the last --plan file>.dot` |
| `--output <PATH>` | `pipelines/<stem>.dot` | Output file path |
| `--json` | false | Print one JSON object on stdout (not supported in directory mode) |

#### JSON output (`--json`)

Success: `{"v":1,"ok":true,"pipeline_path":"/abs/path.dot"}`. Failure (exit 1): `{"v":1,"ok":false,"error":{"code","message"}}` with codes `plan_input`, `io`, `llm_failed`, `invalid_dot`, `invalid_pipeline` (the file is written but has validation errors). Spinner and notices go to stderr, and the spinner is suppressed.

#### Modes

**Single-file mode:**
```bash
pas generate my-spec.md                    # Spec only
pas generate my-prd.md my-spec.md          # PRD + spec (positional)
pas generate --prd prd.md --spec spec.md   # PRD + spec (named)
```

**Directory mode:**
```bash
pas generate docs/implementation/
```

In directory mode, files ending in `-spec.md` are discovered and sorted lexically. Each spec is paired with a matching `-prd.md` if one exists (e.g. `auth-spec.md` pairs with `auth-prd.md`). One `.dot` pipeline is generated per spec.

#### Timeout tiers

Generated pipelines assign timeouts to every node based on complexity:

| Tier | Timeout | Used for |
|------|---------|----------|
| Trivial | 120s | Conditionals, haiku routing, reading a single file |
| Light | 300s | Linting, formatting checks, simple single-step verification |
| Standard | 600s | Investigation, verification with iteration, fixups, most work nodes |
| Heavy | 900s | Implementing features, writing substantial new code |
| Intensive | 1200s | Full test suites, large refactors, multi-step builds |

#### Output

Writes the pipeline to the output path, validates it, and prints node count and validation status.

#### Examples

```bash
# Generate from a spec
pas generate docs/auth-spec.md

# Generate with PRD for richer context
pas generate docs/auth-prd.md docs/auth-spec.md

# Generate all pipelines from a directory of specs
pas generate docs/implementation/

# Then run it
pas run pipelines/auth-spec.dot -w .
```

---

### `scaffold` — Generate pipeline from beads epic

Creates a pipeline DOT file from a beads epic. The pipeline iterates through all child tasks of the epic, implementing each one.

```
pas scaffold <EPIC_ID> [OPTIONS]
```

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `EPIC_ID` | Yes | Beads epic ID (e.g., `beads-asr`) |

#### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--output <PATH>` | `pipelines/<EPIC_ID>.dot` | Output file path (overwritten if it exists) |
| `--json` | off | Print one JSON object instead of text (see below) |

#### Output

Generates a DOT pipeline file from the `epic-runner` template. `bd show <EPIC_ID>` supplies the goal text, and the `beads.select` node gets `epic="<id>"` using the ID `bd show` returned. The result is validated exactly as `pas validate` does (including the check that `bd` is on PATH), then the node count and validation status are printed.

The scaffolded Pipeline loops over the Epic's child Tasks:

```
pick_task (beads.select) --MORE--> investigate → implement → run_tests → verify --PASS--> publish → close_task (beads.close) → pick_task
                         --DONE--> done
                         --BLOCKED--> blocked → done
```

PAS claims and closes each Task itself; no prompt runs `bd`. `publish` is a prompt that commits the Task's files and pushes. `close_task` closes the Task only once its Run Commits are on the upstream branch; otherwise it fails and routes back to `publish`, bounded by `--max-steps`. A repository without an upstream branch therefore cannot close Tasks. `BLOCKED` (open Tasks remain but none are ready) ends the Run normally; the Run Journal records `TaskSelectionBlocked`.

With `--json`, stdout carries exactly one object and nothing else (notices and diagnostics go to stderr):

```json
{"v":1,"ok":true,"pipeline_path":"/abs/path/pipelines/e-1.dot"}
{"v":1,"ok":false,"error":{"code":"epic_not_found","message":"bd show failed: ..."}}
```

`pipeline_path` is the absolute path of the written file. On failure the exit code is 1. Error codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `bd_not_found` | `bd` is not on PATH |
| `epic_not_found` | `bd show <EPIC_ID>` exited non-zero; `message` carries its stderr |
| `bd_failed` | `bd` could not be run or its output could not be read |
| `write_failed` | The output file or its directory could not be written |
| `invalid_pipeline` | The scaffolded Pipeline did not compile or has validation errors (the file is left on disk) |

Without `--json`, validation errors are printed as a warning and the command still exits 0.

#### Examples

```bash
# Scaffold a pipeline for an epic
pas scaffold attractor-asr

# Scaffold to a custom path
pas scaffold attractor-asr --output pipelines/auth-feature.dot

# Machine-readable result
pas scaffold attractor-asr --json

# Then run it
pas run pipelines/attractor-asr.dot -w .
```

---

### `launch` — Generate, validate, and run end-to-end

Takes a directory of spec files, generates `.dot` pipelines from them, validates all of them, then runs them sequentially. Equivalent to running `generate` → `validate` → `run` on each pipeline in order.

```
pas launch <DOCS_DIR> [OPTIONS]
```

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DOCS_DIR` | Yes | Directory containing `*-spec.md` (required) and `*-prd.md` (optional) files |

#### Options

| Option | Short | Default | Description |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--workdir <DIR>` | `-w` | current directory | Working directory for selected provider CLI sessions during the run phase. |
| `--output <DIR>` | `-o` | `pipelines/` | Directory where generated `.dot` files are written. |
| `--dry-run` | — | false | Generate and validate pipelines but don't execute them. |
| `--max-budget-usd <AMOUNT>` | — | $200 | Maximum tracked spend across all nodes in each pipeline. Codex and Gemini CLI calls do not report dollar cost and therefore do not count toward this limit. |
| `--max-steps <COUNT>` | — | 200 | Maximum node executions per pipeline. |
| `--fresh` | — | false | Ignore checkpoints and start each pipeline from scratch. |
| `--codergen-claude-settings-mode <MODE>` | — | `subscription-bare` | Claude settings mode for generated pipelines' `codergen` nodes. Same semantics as `pas run`. |
| `--codergen-claude-setting-sources <LIST>` | — | — | Comma-separated setting sources for `inherit` mode. |
| `--codergen-claude-settings <JSON_OR_FILE>` | — | — | PAS-owned Claude settings JSON or file path for run-phase `codergen` nodes. |
| `--codergen-claude-tools <TOOLS>` | — | Claude default | Explicit Claude built-in tool surface for run-phase `codergen` nodes. |
| `--codergen-claude-agents <JSON>` | — | — | PAS-owned Claude agents JSON for run-phase `codergen` nodes. |
| `--codergen-claude-plugin-dir <DIR>` | — | — | PAS-owned Claude plugin directory for run-phase `codergen` nodes. Repeatable. |
| `--codergen-claude-mcp-config <JSON_OR_FILE>` | — | none | Explicit MCP config for run-phase `codergen` nodes. |

#### How it works

1. **Generate** — discovers `*-spec.md` files in `DOCS_DIR`, pairs each with a `*-prd.md` if one exists (matched by replacing `-spec` with `-prd`), and generates one `.dot` pipeline per spec. Files are sorted lexically — use zero-padded prefixes to control order (`phase-01-spec.md`, `phase-02-spec.md`).
2. **Validate** — runs all lint rules against every generated pipeline. Stops if any pipeline has errors.
3. **Run** — executes each validated pipeline sequentially with checkpoint/resume.

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | All pipelines completed successfully |
| 1 | Generation failed, validation error, or pipeline execution failed |

#### Examples

```bash
# Generate + validate + run all specs in docs/implementation/
pas launch docs/implementation/ -w .

# With a budget cap (recommended for unattended runs)
pas launch docs/implementation/ -w . --max-budget-usd 30.00

# Dry run to preview what would be generated and validated
pas launch docs/implementation/ --dry-run

# Write generated .dot files to a custom directory
pas launch docs/implementation/ -w . -o build/pipelines/
```

---

### `init` — Initialise a `pas.toml` in your project

Detects the project toolchain from well-known config files (`Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, …) and writes a starter `pas.toml` to the nearest `.git` root.

```
pas init [OPTIONS]
```

#### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--workdir <DIR>` | `.` (current directory) | Directory to inspect for toolchain detection and to write `pas.toml`. |
| `--force` | false | Overwrite an existing `pas.toml` and proceed even without a `.git` root. |
| `--non-interactive` | false | Never prompt; fail instead of asking questions. Suitable for CI. |
| `--no-enrich` | false | Skip LLM enrichment for polyglot repos (always skipped in v1; reserved for future use). |
| `--dry-run` | false | Print what would be written without touching the filesystem. |

#### How it works

1. Walks up from `--workdir` to find the nearest `.git` root.
2. Detects the primary toolchain by looking for `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, etc.
3. In interactive mode, shows a preview of the generated `pas.toml` and asks for confirmation.
4. Writes `pas.toml` with `[project]`, `[toolchain]`, and `[quality]` sections pre-populated for the detected language.

#### Generated file layout

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"

[toolchain]
language = "rust"
version = "1.80"

[quality]
stages = ["fmt", "lint", "test"]
max_fix_iterations = 3

[quality.hooks.fmt]
cmd = "cargo fmt --check"

[quality.hooks.lint]
cmd = "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"

[quality.hooks.test]
cmd = "cargo test"
```

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | `pas.toml` written successfully (or `--dry-run` printed it) |
| 1 | Error writing the file |
| 4 | No `.git` root found and `--force` not passed in non-interactive mode |

#### Examples

```bash
# Detect toolchain and write pas.toml interactively
pas init

# Dry-run: preview the generated file without writing it
pas init --dry-run

# CI-safe: non-interactive, fail if no .git root
pas init --non-interactive

# Force-write even without a .git root (e.g. in a monorepo subdirectory)
pas init --force

# Init for a project in a different directory
pas init --workdir ~/projects/my-app
```

---

### `trust` — Manage the pas.toml trust store

Controls which `pas.toml` manifests are trusted to run quality stages. The trust store lives at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pas/trusted.json` (default: `~/.config/pas/trusted.json`).

```
pas trust <ACTION>
```

#### Subcommands

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `add <PATH> <HASH>` | Add a manifest to the trust store by path + blake3 hash |
| `remove <PATH> <HASH>` | Remove a manifest from the trust store |
| `list` | Print all currently trusted manifests |

#### Trust bypass environment variables

| Variable | Value | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `PAS_TRUST_THIS` | `1` | Trust all manifests unconditionally (for development) |
| `PAS_AGENT` | `1` | Non-interactive agent mode — never prompts, never trusts |
| `PAS_NON_INTERACTIVE` | `1` | Suppress trust prompts in CI |

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Action completed successfully |
| 1 | Trust store corrupted or I/O error |
| 2 | Manifest not trusted (checked at `pas run` time, not here) |
| 3 | Trust store corrupted (deserialization failure) |

#### Examples

```bash
# Add a manifest to the trust store
pas trust add /path/to/project/pas.toml <blake3-hash>

# List all trusted manifests
pas trust list

# Remove a manifest
pas trust remove /path/to/project/pas.toml <blake3-hash>
```

### `--json` contract tests

Every `--json` payload (decompose, scaffold, generate, validate, run, answer, stop, kill, runs) is pinned by a golden success and failure file in `crates/attractor-cli/tests/golden/json/`, checked by `tests/json_contract.rs`. Volatile values (paths, Run IDs, PIDs, timestamps, messages) are replaced with placeholders. After a deliberate payload change, regenerate with `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p attractor-cli --test json_contract` and review the diff.

## Global exit code reference

| Code | Meaning | Raised by |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | Success | all commands |
| 1 | General failure (validation error, handler error, quality loop exhausted, unreadable Run Index) | `run`, `runs`, `validate`, `launch`, `trust` |
| 2 | Manifest not trusted | `run` (when quality stages attempted with untrusted `pas.toml`) |
| 3 | Trust store corrupted | `run`, `trust` |
| 4 | No `.git` root found without `--force` | `init` |
| 5 | Pipeline already running | `run`, `launch` |
| 6 | The Run's git worktree is busy with another process (override with `--allow-shared-workdir`) | `run`, `launch` |
| 7 | The Human Gate question is already answered; existing answer unchanged | `answer` |

## Examples

### Run with a budget limit (recommended for loops)

```bash
pas run pipelines/epic-runner.dot -w . --max-budget-usd 10.00
```

If total spend across all nodes exceeds $10, the pipeline stops with an error. Prevents a looping pipeline from running up a massive bill overnight.

### Run with a step limit

```bash
pas run pipelines/epic-runner.dot -w . --max-steps 50
```

Limits the pipeline to 50 node executions. For an epic runner with ~7 nodes per loop, this allows ~7 iterations before stopping. The default is 200 steps.

### Run with both limits (safest for unattended runs)

```bash
pas run pipelines/epic-runner.dot -w . --max-budget-usd 20.00 --max-steps 100
```

The pipeline stops at whichever limit is hit first.

### Run a pipeline in your project directory

```bash
pas run pipelines/fix-bug.dot -w .
```

The `-w .` sets the working directory to the current directory. Selected provider CLIs and tool commands use this path as their working directory.

### Run a pipeline for a different project

```bash
pas run ~/pipelines/deploy-check.dot -w ~/projects/my-app
```

The pipeline file and working directory don't need to be in the same place.

### Validate before running

```bash
pas validate pipelines/new-feature.dot && \
pas run pipelines/new-feature.dot -w .
```

Only runs if validation passes.

### Inspect a pipeline to see its structure

```bash
pas info pipelines/epic-runner.dot
```

Quick way to see the nodes and verify the graph shape before running.

### Debug a failing pipeline

```bash
pas -v run pipelines/fix-bug.dot -w .
```

The `-v` flag enables debug logging. You'll see:
- Which handler is selected for each node
- Edge selection decisions (condition evaluation, label matching)
- Context updates after each node
- Goal gate check results

### Dry run to verify parsing

```bash
pas run pipelines/complex-feature.dot --dry-run
```

Parses and validates the pipeline, prints the structure, but doesn't execute any selected provider CLI or tool command. Zero cost.

### Run from anywhere with an alias

Add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
alias pas='~/.local/bin/pas'
```

Then:

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
pas run pipelines/fix-auth.dot -w .
pas validate pipelines/new-feature.dot
pas info pipelines/deploy.dot
```

### Pipeline for a beads issue

```bash
# Look up the issue
bd show baseball-v3-vfd5

# Run the pipeline that fixes it
pas run pipelines/fix-sync-partial-failure.dot -w ~/gt/baseball
```

### Process an entire epic

```bash
# Copy the epic runner template
cp /Volumes/qwiizlab/projects/connect-the-bots/docs/examples/epic-runner.dot pipelines/run-epic.dot

# Replace EPIC_ID with your epic
sed -i '' 's/EPIC_ID/baseball-v3-8xey/g' pipelines/run-epic.dot

# Run it — loops through all child tasks
pas run pipelines/run-epic.dot -w .
```

### Chain validate + run in CI or scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

PIPELINE="$1"
WORKDIR="${2:-.}"

echo "Validating $PIPELINE..."
pas validate "$PIPELINE"

echo "Running $PIPELINE in $WORKDIR..."
pas run "$PIPELINE" -w "$WORKDIR"
```

Usage: `./run-pipeline.sh pipelines/fix-bug.dot ~/projects/my-app`

### Full planning workflow (PRD → Spec → Beads → Pipeline → Execute)

```bash
# Step 1: Generate a PRD from a description
pas plan --prd --from-prompt "Add real-time notifications via WebSockets"

# Step 2: Review and edit .pas/prd.md manually

# Step 3: Generate a spec from a description (or copy template and edit)
pas plan --spec --from-prompt "Add real-time notifications via WebSockets"

# Step 4: Review and edit .pas/spec.md manually

# Step 5: Decompose spec into beads epic + tasks
pas decompose .pas/spec.md

# Step 6: Scaffold pipeline from the epic
pas scaffold <EPIC_ID>

# Step 7: Run the pipeline
pas run pipelines/<EPIC_ID>.dot -w .
```

### Run the meta-pipeline (automated full workflow)

```bash
pas run templates/plan-to-execute.dot -w .
```

The meta-pipeline chains all planning steps with human review gates. It generates PRD, pauses for review, generates spec, pauses for review, decomposes into beads, scaffolds the pipeline, validates, and executes.

### Compare two pipelines

```bash
pas info pipelines/v1.dot
pas info pipelines/v2.dot
```

Quick way to compare node counts and structure between pipeline revisions.

## Environment

### Required

- Every provider binary selected by an executable `codergen` node must be in
  `PATH`: `claude`, `codex`, and/or `gemini`. Unselected provider binaries are
  not required. Verify a selected binary with `command -v <provider>`.

### Optional

- **`PAS_STATE_DIR`** — Folder for machine-wide PAS state: the Run Index (`runs.jsonl`) and Monitor Plan workspaces (`plans/<plan-id>/`). Default `$XDG_STATE_HOME/pas`, else `~/.local/state/pas`.
- **`RUST_LOG`** — Override log level (e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug pas run ...`). The `-v` flag sets this to `debug` automatically.

### What a Claude agent process gets

Each `claude` node starts `claude` in the workdir, in its own process group,
with stdin from `/dev/null` (it never reads `pas`'s stdin). Its environment is
`pas`'s own, with these changes:

- **Removed**, so the agent runs on your Claude subscription and never on a key
  it happened to inherit: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`,
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`. Variables whose name or value is not UTF-8 are not
  passed either.
- **Set** by PAS (any value `pas` itself had is replaced):
  - `PAS_RUN_ID`: the Run's id (as in `run.json`); unset outside a Run.
  - `PAS_NODE_ID`: the node's id.
  - `PAS_ATTEMPT`: the attempt at this node, from 1.
  - `PAS_INVOCATION_ID`: this Model Invocation's id, the same as
    `LlmInvoked.invocation_id` and the Transcript's file name.

Its stderr is written, as it arrives, to `transcripts/<invocation-id>.stderr.log`
next to the Transcript, and kept after the process ends (or crashes).

When an agent times out (after `max_retries`) or crashes, the error that ends
the Run names the node, the attempt and both files (absolute paths), and a
crash also shows the last stderr lines:

```
node 'work' attempt 2 failed: timeout after 1000ms; transcript /…/transcripts/<id>.jsonl; stderr /…/transcripts/<id>.stderr.log
Handler 'codergen' failed on node 'work': attempt 1: Claude Code exited with exit status: 3; last stderr lines:
<up to 10 lines>
transcript /…/transcripts/<id>.jsonl; stderr /…/transcripts/<id>.stderr.log
```

**Stopping it.** On the node's timeout, or when the Run is stopped (SIGTERM to
`pas run`, as `pas kill` sends), PAS sends TERM to the agent's process group,
waits the profile's `kill_grace` (built-in 10 s), then sends KILL. A stopped Run starts no new stage,
waits for the agent to exit, journals `AttemptEnded` with reason `stopped` and
exits 143; the stopped stage records no `StageFailed`, and resuming the Run runs
it again.

Codex and Gemini nodes run the same way, through their profiles (see
[Agent profiles](#agent-profiles-agentsname-in-pastoml)).

## Node-level Claude Code flags

These are set in the `.dot` file as node attributes and passed through to each `claude -p` invocation:

| Node attribute | Claude CLI flag | Effect |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| `llm_model` | `--model` | Override model for this node |
| `allowed_tools` | `--allowedTools` | Restrict available tools |
| `max_budget_usd` | `--max-budget-usd` | Cap spending for this node |
| Graph `model` | `--model` (fallback) | Default model when node doesn't specify one |

Every node also gets:
- `--output-format stream-json --verbose` — streamed JSON events; PAS parses the final `result` event
- `--no-session-persistence` — each node is a fresh session
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — allows file edits and bash execution
- `--strict-mcp-config --disable-slash-commands` — only the MCP config PAS passes; no slash commands

A final `result` event with `is_error` or a `subtype` starting `error` (such as
`error_max_turns`) makes the node fail.

### Examples in DOT

```dot
// Cheap read-only investigation using haiku
investigate [
    shape="box"
    llm_provider="claude"
    llm_model="haiku"
    allowed_tools="Read,Grep,Glob"
    prompt="Find all usages of deprecated_function"
]

// Expensive deep analysis using opus with a budget cap
analyze [
    shape="box"
    llm_provider="claude"
    llm_model="opus"
    max_budget_usd="5.00"
    prompt="Perform a security audit of the authentication module"
]

// Default model (inherits from graph-level model attribute)
implement [
    shape="box"
    llm_provider="claude"
    prompt="Fix the SQL injection in the search endpoint"
]
```
